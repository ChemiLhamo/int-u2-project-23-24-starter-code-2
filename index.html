      <p>Here at It Never Stops, we are dedicated to bringing police brutality to an end. We believe that police brutality is a major concern that needs to be addressed. We want to create a platform where people can come together and share their experiences and perspectives on police brutality. This is a space where people can come together and learn from each other's experiences. We are a committed team of individuals who are passionate about this cause and are passionate about making a difference in the lives of those who have been a victim of police brutality. </p>

      <h2>Victims of police violence</h2>
      <p> George Floyd: On May 25, 2020 Minneapolis polie officers arrested George Floyd, a 46 year old black man after a 911 call from a convenience store employee claiming Mr. Floyd has bought cigarettes with a fake $20 bill. After seventeen minutes after the first squad car arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three police officers. The officers then dragged Mr. Floyd to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.
